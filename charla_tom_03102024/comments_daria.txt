In the present work, we are exploring the possible effects of
perturbations on streamer dynamics within a range of parameter
sets rather than trying to reproduce realistic scenarios. It is
believed that the streamers form in the slow solar wind environ-
ment and are not observed in the fast solar wind. However, FSW
setup can result in a better understanding of the MHD Doppler
shift effect. A more observational-data-driven setup will be the
subject of a future study
